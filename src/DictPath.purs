{- The following is the type that the compiler suggests:
     mapToAnimal :: forall b a m. At m a b => a -> (forall p. Strong p => p (Maybe b) (Maybe b) -> p m m)
   Interestingly, if you uncomment that, you'll get the following error:

  35  mapToAnimal = at
                    ^^
  Could not match constrained type
  
    Strong t3 => t3 (Maybe t4) (Maybe t4) -> t3 t5 t5
  
  with type
  
    Strong p6 => p6 (Maybe b1) (Maybe b1) -> p6 m2 m2


What's up with that? Compiler error?

   What I *want* to say with these three lenses is this:

   modelToTag id =
     modelToAnimals <<< animalsToAnimal id <<< animalToTags

   I can get partway there with this:

     > :t view (modelToAnimals <<< animalsToAnimal "jake") model
     Maybe          
       { tags :: Int
       }

   ... but I don't know how to add on past that.
